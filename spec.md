# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - I have done this by providing a Company Controller Object that provides output and user input.
- [x] Pull data from an external source - I have done this twice by scraping fortune 500's website and its individual companies sub-sites using Nokogiri
- [x] Implement both list and detail views - I have done this by providing a list view of companies for the user, and providing a detail view for the output.
